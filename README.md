# Deploy Spring Boot Applications to AWS using Elastic Beanstalk

## Take your first steps towards cloud with AWS Elastic Beanstalk. Deploy REST APIs, Full Stack Applications, Web Applications and Containers to the cloud.

Spring Boot is the No 1 Java Framework to develop REST API and Microservices. AWS (Amazon Web Services) is the No 1 Cloud Service Provider today.

How about learning AWS by deploying Spring Applications to Cloud using Elastic Beanstalk?

In this course, we deploy a variety of Spring Boot Applications to the Cloud:
- REST APIs - Hello World and Todo - Jar
- Todo Web Application War
- Full Stack Application with React and Spring Boot
- Single Container with REST API
- Multi Container with Todo REST API talking to MySQL

You will learn about automating deployments with Elastic Beanstalk CLI and creating a continuous delivery pipeline with AWS Code Pipeline. You will learn how to Auto Scale applications based on load as well as deploy multiple instances behind a load balancer using Elastic Beanstalk.

~~~ Here are a Few Reviews on The in28Minutes Way ~~~

★★★★★ Excellent, fabulous. The way he has prepared the material and the way he teaches is really awesome. What an effort .. Thanks a million
★★★★★ A lot of preparation work has taken place from the teacher and this is visible throughout the course.
★★★★★ This guy is fantastic. Really. Wonderful teaching skills, and goes well out of his way to make sure that everything he is doing is fully understood. This is the kind of tutorial that gets me excited to work with a framework that I may otherwise not be.
★★★★★ The best part of it is the hands-on approach which the author maintained throughout the course as he had promised at the beginning of the lecture. He explains the concepts really well and also makes sure that there is not a single line of code you type without understanding what it really does.
★★★★★ I also appreciate the mind and hands approach of teaching something and then having the student apply it. It makes everything a lot clearer for the student and uncovers issues that we will face in our project early.
★★★★★ Amazing course. Explained super difficult concepts (that I have spent hours on the internet finding a good explanation) in under 5 minutes.
