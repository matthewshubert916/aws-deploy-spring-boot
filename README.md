# Deploy Spring Boot Applications to AWS using Elastic Beanstalk

## Take your first steps towards cloud with AWS Elastic Beanstalk. Deploy REST APIs, Full Stack Applications, Web Applications and Containers to the cloud.

Spring Boot is the No 1 Java Framework to develop REST API and Microservices. AWS (Amazon Web Services) is the No 1 Cloud Service Provider today.

How about learning AWS by deploying Spring Applications to Cloud using Elastic Beanstalk?

In this course, we deploy a variety of Spring Boot Applications to the Cloud:
- REST APIs - Hello World and Todo - Jar
- Todo Web Application War
- Full Stack Application with React and Spring Boot
- Single Container with REST API
- Multi Container with Todo REST API talking to MySQL

You will learn about automating deployments with Elastic Beanstalk CLI and creating a continuous delivery pipeline with AWS Code Pipeline. You will learn how to Auto Scale applications based on load as well as deploy multiple instances behind a load balancer using Elastic Beanstalk.
